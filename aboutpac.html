                    <h3>ABOUT PAC PROJECT</h3>
The overall objective of the study is to explore the scope and quality of post-abortion care in public health facilities in Nigeria.
Quality of health care has been a core pillar of health systems reforms since the World Health Organization [WHO] publication titled, The world health report 2000: Health systems: Improving performance committed significant parts to the need to make health systems address users’ expectations. Generally framed as quality of health care, it is characterized as the extent to which health-care services provided to individuals and patient populations to advance looked-for health outcomes. We will draw on the seminal work of Donabedian, which provides three core-connected ingredients for assessing health care quality. These are <br />
    <ul>
        <li>structure (facility infrastructure, management and staffing),</li>
        <li>process (technical/technical quality and patient experience) and</li>
        <li>outcomes (patient satisfaction, return visits and health outcomes).</li>

    </ul>            
Unsafe abortion remains one of the major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in Nigeria. Tackling unsafe abortion is thus clearly a key to the achievement of SDGs 3 Target 1, as well as the promotion of health and wellbeing in Nigeria. An important first step to building sustainable change on SRHR issues rests on generating and using robust and contextual evidence to inform solutions to problems; midwifing enabling normative environments; fostering collaboration and networking around comprehensive SRHR services at scale; ensuring supportive advocacy; and expanding individual and relational agency. Our theory of change is that the delivery of quality PAC services can be catalyzed through the generation of a robust body of evidence that is used to rally SRHR networks and partnerships; build SRHR leadership, inform advocacy; and support capacity to identify, test, adapt, and scale up best and proven practices.<br /> <br />
<strong>KEY QUESTIONS</strong><br />
This study seeks to answer the following research questions:
<ol>
    <li>How equipped are public health facilities in Nigeria to deliver basic and comprehensive post-abortion care?</li>
    <li>What is the quality of PAC services offered in healthcare facilities in the country? </li>
    <li>What are the barriers to the provision of quality PAC services in the country? </li>
    <li>How do PAC providers and patients understand quality in the context of post-abortion care?</li>
</ol>

                    <h3>PAC PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
This will be a cross-sectional study, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative approaches to investigate the aforesaid objectives. The study will have the following components: 
●	A survey of PAC clients in a random sample of health facilities across Nigeria, and conduct of exit interviews; 
●	A survey of facilities to assess their capacity to provide basic and comprehensive PAC;
●	In-depth interviews with a sample of women seeking care for PAC as well as health service providers and policy makers about their notions of what constitutes quality PAC. 
Study population
In each sampled facility, facility managers will be included in the study. A sample of women who have been treated for PAC in the selected facilities will be interviewed upon discharge from the facilities in exit interviews. PAC providers in the sampled facilities include obstetricians and gynecologists, midwives, and other health personnel who treat women with abortion complications will be included in the study. 
The sample of health facilities does not include those in prisons; therefore, women who are incarcerated will not be involved in the study. The sample also excludes private facilities. 

Sampling
A simple random sampling was done to determine the study sites following which Anambra, Bauchi, Cross River, Edo, Kano and Kogi states with the federal capital territory (Abuja) were selected. 
The sample will be drawn from the total number of functional public health facilities capable of providing PAC in the randomly selected states as of July 2018. We are focusing on public facilities on account of the fact that government investments in service improvements are principally directed to public health facilities. Specialist facilities that do not offer PAC and lower level facilities such as dispensaries, which are not likely to provide PAC, will be excluded from the frame. We estimate that the current study will require a sample size of 223 facilities. These facilities will be allocated across the randomly selected states and in each state this will comprise the different facility levels proportionate to the population of facilities by level of care in each state. By default all tertiary institutions that offer PAC in each state would be include in the state sample size. A further 30% representative replacement sample of facilities will also be randomly drawn proportionate to the number of facilities in each state for replacement of all hard-to-reach sampled facilities.  

A sample of 163 PAC patients will be required for each of the 6 states plus the FCT. This yields a total sample of 1141 PAC patients in total. 

Provider and signal functions data 
After confirming eligibility of the health facilities for participation, research assistants will visit each facility and administer a questionnaire pertaining to facility type, staffing, reproductive health and abortion services provided, and available equipment and commodities for basic and comprehensive PAC. At large facilities, such as main referral hospitals, the key informant/respondent would be the chief of the obstetrics and gynecology department, or a key obstetrician-gynecologist working in the facility. At lower level facilities, a nurse, a midwife or another health worker in a position to provide information on abortion care offered in that facility will be interviewed. Sampled facilities that decline to participate in the study will be replaced with similar facilities from the representative replacement sample frame.  
Patient exit interviews 
Women will be interviewed upon discharge when they would have received the full complement of treatment for PAC from the sampled health facilities. The aim of the exit interviews is to collect data complementary to that obtained from the signal function. Research assistants assigned to each sampled health facility will conduct these interviews. All women treated for incomplete and spontaneous abortion in the selected health facilities and agree to participate will be included in the study until the desired sample size is achieved for each country. We seek to use non-providers in order to avoid patients feeling intimidated being interviewed by providers. Adolescents below 18 years will be included given that they are emancipated minors as a result of having being pregnant. Data collection will take place in facilities over a period of 30 consecutive days. This survey will collect data on the socio-demographic information, reproductive history, post abortion care received, post-abortion contraception and the wellbeing after clinical management. 
Qualitative study 
In-depth interviews
Apart from the quantitative survey, we will conduct 50 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with a sample of PAC clients in each country. Qualitative interviews will explore the experiences and perspectives of patients and providers in relation to PAC quality and services. The goal of purposive selection is to ensure richness and variations based on patient-characteristics. 
We will also separately interview between 40 PAC providers (e.g. nurse-midwives, medical doctors, clinical officers, obstetricians and gynecologists) in each country to gain deeper insights into their notions of quality regarding PAC (how their practices fulfill or not the guidelines, theirs interactions with patients). 
At a third level, we will also conduct 12 interviews with policy makers such technical agents of the Ministry of Health as well as NGOs and international institutions working on PAC in Nigeria. The objective is to document national PAC strategies in terms of development of guidelines, training, their level of deployment and gaps likely to impact PAC quality. 
Observation
These in-depth interviews will be associated with observations of the situations of PAC provision in health facilities. Observation will be done by the fieldworkers while waiting to meet and interview the patients. The objectives of these observations is to grasp the behaviors and interactions between patients and PAC providers at the moment they occur without having to go through a third person discourses.

                    <h3>PAC PROJECT RESULT AND DISSEMINATION</h3>
Our study will provide robust and comparative evidence base on the situation of PAC services in Nigeria. By determining the state of PAC services, and clarifying barriers to the provision of quality PAC, we will equip a range of stakeholders, including providers with information, evidence, and capacity to address the situation in the country.
